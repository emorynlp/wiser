Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said that the Communist Party will not be overthrown - if it falls, it will be brought down from within the party itself. Former US Ambassador to China Mr. Huntsman once said in a speech in the US: we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in China, let the Chinese themselves topple China - and the CIA then used an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so-called elite, vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically, citizens definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsiders use us.
