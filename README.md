# Widely Interpretable Meaning Representation

This folder contains:

- The dialogue corpus from [anonymous submission] annotated in AMR, WISeR, and an automatic conversion of AMR into WISeR.
- The converted (trimmed) AMR3.0 --> WISeR corpus (with Train, Dev, Test split).
- The guidelines used by annotators during the annotation task.

Processing and evaluation scripts will be released on our public github repository when anonymization period is complete.
